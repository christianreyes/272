  # More shoulda testing for the other methods, etc.
  # by setting up context(s)
  #
  # Start with a simple example
  context "A new child" do
    # create the object I want with a factory with 'setup' method
    setup do
      @mark = Factory.create(:child, :first_name => "Mark")
    end
    
    # write my test of name method
    
    should "has a full name" do
      assert_equal "Mark Heimann", @mark.name
    end
    
    # test the free method
    
    should "and has no chores" do
      assert @mark.free?   #assert returns true if value is true
    end
    
    # now destroy the factory with 'teardown' method
    
    teardown do
      @mark.destroy
    end
    
  end
  
  # --------------------------------
  # Now a more complex context...
  context "Adding children with different chores" do
    # create the objects I want with factories
    setup do 
      @alex = Factory.create(:child)
      @mark = Factory.create(:child, :first_name => "Mark")
      @rachel = Factory.create(:child, :first_name => "Rachel")
      @task = Factory.create(:task)
      @chore = Factory.create(:chore, :child => @mark, :task => @task)
      @chore2 = Factory.create(:chore, :child => @rachel, :task => @task)
      @chore3 = Factory.create(:chore, :child => @rachel, :task => @task)
    end

      @alex.destroy
      @task.destroy
      @chore.destroy

      @chore3.destroy

    # test the counting of chores
    should "shows that Mark has 1 chore" do
      assert_equal 1, @mark.chores.size
    end

    # test the free method again -- should return false
    should "shows Mark still has chores to do" do
      assert !@mark.free?
    end
    
    # test the named scope 'all'
    should "shows all the children are listed here in the right order" do
      assert_equal ["Alex", "Mark", "Rachel"], Child.all.map{|c| c.first_name}
    end
    
    # finally test of name method (one would suffice, actually, but do all three)
    should "shows each has a full name" do
      assert_equal @mark.name, "Mark"
      assert_equal @rachel.name, "Rachel"
